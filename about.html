    <p>Liu Kang was a Singaporean artist known for his Balinese-themed figurative
    paintings. He was a founding member of the Singapore Art Society, and was
    credited with developing the Nanyang Style of painting, an art style
    associated with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. His works are widely
    collected, with many of his works currently on display at the National
    Gallery in Singapore. He is also the father of the architect Liu Thai Ker.</p>
    
    <p>Liu Kang was born in Fujian Province, china in 1911. He spent his early
    years in Malaysia, studied art in Shanghai and Paris (at the Academie de
    Grande Chaumiere from 1929 to 1933), and taught art in Shanghai during the 1930s.</p>
    
    <p>Under the influence of Chinese artist and art teacher Liu Haisu
    (1896–1994), Liu admired, and often appropriated the styles of French-based
    modernist painters such as Paul Cézanne, Cézanne, van Gogh and Matisse. Liu
    moved to Singapore in 1942 and had been credited with numerous contributions to the local arts scene.</p>
    
    <p>Several his works also took influence from WWII when Liu Kang and his family were forced to flee to Muar in Malaya. 
    He witnessed many alleged atrocities by the Japanese soldiers on the local
    population, and after the war ended in 1946, he published a collection of
    sketches documenting these atrocities in a multi volume work titled ‘Chop Suey’.</p>
    
    <p>It was this mixture of western and Asian influences that supported
    the creation and development of the Nanyang style of painting.</p> 
    
    <p>In 1952, Liu kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng went on a famous
    field trip to Bali in search of a visual expression that was Southeast Asian
    that also drove the development of the Nanyang style of painting.</p>
    
    <p>In 1970,Liu was awarded the Public Service Star by the Singapore Government. 
    He was honored by the same agency in 1996 with the Meritorious Service Medal.</p>
    
    <p>Despite his failing eyesight and a failed cataract transplant in 1986, Liu
    Kang continued to paint and exhibit his works. His most significant
    exhibition prior to his passing was held in China in 2000, after having
    postponed it for more than a decade due to the Tiananmen incident in 1989.</p>
    
    <p>In May 2003, the 92-year-old artist gave most of his paintings and sketches,
    amounting to over 1,000 pieces, to the Singapore Art Museum. He also
    unveiled a painting of three Balinese women, each carrying a basket, titled Offerings.</p>
    
    <p>He passed away on June 1st 2004 at the age of 93. To commemorate
    the 100th year of Liu's birth, the National Art Gallery, Singapore, together
    with the Global Chinese Arts & Culture Society and Lianhe Zaobao, held a
    forum titled "Liu Kang: Tropical Vanguard" on 2 April 2011. The forum
    brought together a panel of established artists and scholars to discuss
    Liu's significant influence and contributions to Singapore's art history.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of Singapore, Liu Kang’s works have been extensively exhibited
    internationally, including France, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and the USA. He
    is one of the most respected, influential and highest grossing Singaporean
    artists thus far and no doubt his works will continue to be appreciated for
    many years to come.
