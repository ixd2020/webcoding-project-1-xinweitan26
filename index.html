    <h2>Welcome to Liu Kang website</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Liu Kang (Chinese: 刘抗; pinyin: Liú Kàng) </b>
      was a Singaporean artist known for his <em>Balinese-themed figurative paintings. </em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>He was a founding member of the Singapore Art Society, and was credited with developing the Nanyang Style, </strong>
      an art style associated with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.[1] 
      He is also the father of the architect <i>Liu Thai Ker.</i>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Liu was born in Fujian Province and he spent his early years in Malaysia, <br>
      studied art in Shanghai and Paris, and taught art in Shanghai during the 1930s. <br>
      Under the influence of Chinese artist and art teacher Liu Haisu (1896–1994), 
      Liu admired, and often appropriated the styles of French-based modernist painters such as Cézanne, 
      van Gogh and Matisse.
