    <p>Liu Kang (Chinese: 刘抗; pinyin: Liú Kàng) was a Singaporean artist known
    for his Balinese-themed figurative paintings. 
    <br>He was a founding member of the Singapore Art Society, and was credited with developing the Nanyang
    Style, an art style associated with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.[1] 
    <br>He is also the father of the architect Liu Thai Ker. 
    <br>Liu was born in Fujian Province and he spent his early years in Malaysia, studied art in Shanghai
    and Paris, and taught art in Shanghai during the 1930s. 
    <br>Under the influence of Chinese artist and art teacher Liu Haisu (1896–1994), Liu admired, and
    often appropriated the styles of French-based modernist painters such as
    Cézanne, van Gogh and Matisse. 
    <br>Liu moved to Singapore in 1942 and had been credited with numerous contributions to the local arts scene. 
    <br>In 1952, Liu,Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng went on a field trip to
    Bali in search of a visual expression that was Southeast Asian. 
    <br>In 1970, Liu was awarded the Public Service Star by the Singapore Government. 
    <br>He was honoured by the same agency in 1996 with the Meritorious Service Medal. 
    <br>In May 2003, the 92-year-old artist gave the majority of his paintings and
    sketches, amounting to over 1,000 pieces, to the Singapore Art Museum. 
    <br>He also unveiled a painting of three Balinese women, each carrying a basket,
    titled Offerings. 
    <br>To commemorate the 100th year of Liu's birth, the National
    Art Gallery, Singapore, together with the Global Chinese Arts & Culture
    Society and Lianhe Zaobao, held a forum titled "Liu Kang: Tropical Vanguard"
    on 2 April 2011. 
    <br>The forum brought together a panel of established artists
    and scholars to discuss Liu's significant influence and contributions to
    Singapore's art history.</p>
