        <p><p>Nanyang style of painting was a creation and development of the mixture of western and Asian influences.</p> 
    <p>Liu Kang was a founding member of the Singapore Art Society, and was credited with developing the Nanyang Style of painting, 
    an art style associated with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. 
    His works are widely collected, with many of his works currently on display at the National Gallery in Singapore.</p>
    <p>In 1952, Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng went on a famous field trip to Bali 
    in search of a visual expression that was Southeast Asian that also drove the development of the Nanyang style of painting.</p>
    <p>In 1970, Liu was awarded the Public Service Star by the Singapore Government.
    He was honored by the same agency in 1996 with the Meritorious Service Medal.</p>
    <p>Despite his failing eyesight and a failed cataract transplant in 1986, Liu Kang continued to paint and exhibit his works. 
    His most significant exhibition prior to his passing was held in China in November 2000, 
    after having postponed it for more than a decade due to the Tiananmen incident in 1989.
    Liu Kang artwork have been exhibited in Singapore, France, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and the United States.</p>
    <p>In May 2003, the 92-year-old artist gave most of his paintings and sketches, amounting to over 1,000 pieces, 
    to the Singapore Art Museum. He also unveiled a painting of three Balinese women, each carrying a basket, titled Offerings.</p>
    <p>He passed away on June 1st, 2004 at the age of 93. 
    To commemorate the 100th year of Liu's birth, the National Art Gallery, Singapore, 
    together with the Global Chinese Arts & Culture Society and Lianhe Zaobao, 
    held a forum titled "Liu Kang: Tropical Vanguard" on 2 April 2011. 
    The forum brought together a panel of established artists and scholars 
    to discuss Liu's significant influence and contributions to Singapore's art history.</p></p>

      Note that we also use the clearfix hack to take care of the layout flow,
      and that add the box-sizing property to make sure that the box doesn't
      break due to extra padding. Try to remove this code to see the effect.
